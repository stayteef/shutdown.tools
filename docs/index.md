## Alternative Internet

- [**E-SIM**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESIM) 
    - Using an eSIM allows you to activate a foreign mobile data plan without needing to insert a physical card into your device. It enables you to switch between different mobile networks and access alternative providers that may still be operational, ensuring connectivity even when local networks are restricted. However, it *may not be a good solution in areas with complete network outages* or where all providers are affected.
    - There are different providers of eSIM services that you can use. However, most of them are private commercial companies that *may not prioritise your privacy*. 
    - In some countries, eSIM providers may be blocked (e.g., [Turkiye](https://esimradar.com/turkey-blocks-esim-providers/))

- [**Iodine**](https://www.kali.org/tools/iodine/) 
    - This software allows you to tunnel IPv4 data through a DNS server. This can be usable in different situations where internet access is *firewalled*, but DNS queries are allowed.
    - **Iodine requires a higher level of technical proficiency in using the terminal**.

- [**Satellite Internet**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_Internet_access)

    - There are a few satellite internet providers on the market. When making a decision, consider factors such as **usability, legality, cost, and [latency](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/performance/glossary/what-is-latency/)**. 
    - Please be aware of the [risks associated with satellite internet](https://satellitesafety.openinternetproject.org/). If you prefer not to be detected while using satellite internet, be cautious of [RF emissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_radio_emissions) and unplug the device when not in use.

Below you can see the examples of commercial providers of satellite internet. Please check if they are available and *can be legally used* in your country, or region.

## VPN

There are multiple VPNs on the market, and we have not included all of them. Our standard criteria include providers that meet at least some of the following: open source, strong encryption, independent security audits, a no-logs policy, a track record of supporting human rights, and not being owned by data mining companies. However, each VPN operates differently with various protocols. We recommend ensuring it works in your region.

 <span style="color:red; font-style:italic;">Using VPNs may be illegal in some countries. VPNs require a small amount of data to connect, making them ineffective during a full shutdown but potentially useful during throttling.</span>
