## Alternative Internet
- [**E-SIM**](#) - Using an eSIM allows you to activate a foreign mobile data plan without needing to insert a physical card into your device. It enables you to switch between different mobile networks and access alternative providers that may still be operational, ensuring connectivity even when local networks are restricted. However, it may not be a good solution in areas with complete network outages or where all providers are affected.

- [**Iodine**](https://www.kali.org/tools/iodine/) - This is a piece of software that lets you tunnel IPv4 data through a DNS server. This can be usable in different situations where internet access is firewalled, but DNS queries are allowed.
- [**Satellite Internet**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_Internet_access)

    There are a few satellite internet providers on the market. When making a decision, consider factors such as usability, legality, cost, and latency. Please be aware of the [risks associated with satellite internet](https://satellitesafety.openinternetproject.org/)). If you prefer not to be detected while using satellite internet, be cautious of RF emissions and unplug the device when not in use.

## VPN

There are multiple VPNs on the market, and we have not included all of them. Our standard criteria include providers that meet at least some of the following: open source, strong encryption, independent security audits, a no-logs policy, a track record of supporting human rights, and not being owned by data mining companies. However, each VPN operates differently with various protocols. We recommend ensuring it works in your region.
